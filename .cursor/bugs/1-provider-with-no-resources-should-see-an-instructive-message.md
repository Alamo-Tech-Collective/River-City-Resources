# Provider with no resources should be able to see an instructive message.

See the below text. This comes from a GitHub issue. I would like to be able to solve the GitHub issue as described. Please help me implement this feature.

Right now, if I sign in to the app as a provider who has no resources, all I see is an empty resource list:

<img width="1270" height="748" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23d274dc-8230-4d5c-85da-7fd4d7a01476" />

Instead, I would like to see a message under the resource list header. Something like: `You do not have any approved resources. Please submit a new resource or come back later after an admin has had a chance to review your submission(s).` 

~~This could possibly be fixed with #3 , but I placed it in a separate issue because it's beyond the scope of the original issue #1 . It should be a fairly simple fix.~~
