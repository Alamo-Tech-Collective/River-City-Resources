                    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">For Service Providers</h2>
                    <p>We're building a future where service providers can directly manage their own information through a secure login system. This will allow organizations to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add and update their service information in real-time</li>
                        <li>Manage contact details and hours of operation</li>
                        <li>Update eligibility requirements and service descriptions</li>
                        <li>Ensure their information is always current and accurate</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="alert alert-info">
